# this makefile needs GNU make, since 'shell' is a GNU make extension
# and filter-out
#
# first get list of all PRL-files to check 
# well known problems may be removed from this list to
# perform regression tests
#  remove tests from build: DONOTBUILD
#  remove tests from run: DONOTRUN
#
# --------------------------
# for the usage in jenkins the policy is:
# add all test cases to DONOTBUILD which are recorded in an open ticket
# add all test cases to DONOTRUN which are known that they are intended
#     as build only test cases
# the result of make build is ok, if all test cases work
# the result of make doesnotbuild is ok, if no test cases work
