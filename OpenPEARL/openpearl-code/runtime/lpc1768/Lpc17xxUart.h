   \brief uart support for LPC17xx

   /**
   This class provides uart support for the LPC17xx

   The interrupt is only enabled if the device is opened.

   There is no check if more than one userdation is opened
   on the device. It should no problem, since the operations
   are secured by a mutex.


   As connection to a terminal with line edit functions.

   console: LineEdit(80) --- Lpc17xxUart(....)

   The LineEdit class uses a different interface as the pur dation
   operation, which supplies a raw mode. All data are transfered as specified.
   No early termination on input is possible.
   The line may be used in full duplex
   mode.

   Besides these modes of operation, the communication protocol xon/xoff
   may be selected. This operates in both directions.
   On output, the reception of an XOFF will stop the transmission of more
   characters until an XON is received.
   On input, an XOFF is emitted in case of the reception of a data byte
   with no active input request. The next input action (dationRead()) will
   take the buffered input character and sends an XON.
   The implementation of XonXoff is provided plattform indepoendent in
   GenericUart

   To achieve mutual exclusion between interrupt service routine and
   API function calls, the specific NVI interrupt is cleared and
   set accordingly.

   The UART dation allows multiple open and close operations.
   This provied the possibility to have a normal USERDATION on the
   interface as well as the logging output.
