\subsection{Execution Speed on digital Output}
\label{sec_lpc1768_bitflip}
A task, which sets and resets a bit on the Lpc17xxDigitalOut runs with
a speed of $650 \mu s$ per loop cycle.

\subsection{ALL .. ACTIVATE}
A task which will be started cyclic with the ALL statement may be scheduled 
with a timing resolution of $10 \mu s$. In the test case, the task 
flips a bit of the Lpc17xxDigitalOut. The minimum rate for the activation is 
$1,1 ms$ due the task setup operations and task execution.
In consideration of the timing in section \ref{sec_lpc1768_bitflip}
the task setup needs $650 \mu s$.
