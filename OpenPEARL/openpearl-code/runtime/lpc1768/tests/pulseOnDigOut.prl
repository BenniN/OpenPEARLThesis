/*
send pulses to P1.0

in fast mode the bit is set and reset in a simple loop
this provides a period of approx. 195us

the interactive mode allows to input of the desired period.
the default at start is 1ms.
at 800us the output is still stable.
at 750us the cpu limit is reached and no more interaction is possible
shorter values leed to unpredictable results
