\subsection{Log --- Logging}
The configuration element LOG allows the specification of the 
log output of the OpenPEARL application.

Sample Usage:
\begin{PEARLCode}
Log('EW') --- StdErr;
\end{PEARLCode}

The element LOG needs an output device,
which receives text messages without a file name.
Typical system devices are StdErr, StdOut or LogFile depending on the concrete 
platform. 

The log level is defined by the character string. Possible letters are:
\begin{description}
\item['E'] error messages from signals, even if they are caught
\item['W'] warning from the runtime library
\item['D'] debug messages from the runtime library
\item['I'] informative messages from the runtime library, like the 
    list of defined tasks at system start
\end{description}

The default log level is 'EW'.
