   /**
   \brief READ/WRITE-userdation interface for userdations
           with the class attribute "ALPHIC".

     Defines the methods for the communication of userdations
     (with class attribute "ALPHIC").
     They read/write with the methods PUT/GET (defined by PEARL)
     in external format.
     Some interfaces are inherited from upper classes UserDation.

     The i/o-operations are done via a source/sink object which decouples
     the i/o from the formatting statements.

     The complete operation is treated by a list of data elements and a list
     of format elements. See IODataList and IOFormatList about details.
     For expression results intermediate variable must be defined locally and
     used in the lists. The evaluation of the expressions must be done after 
     creation of the lists and the invocation of the put- or get-method.
