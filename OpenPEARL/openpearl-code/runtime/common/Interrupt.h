   /**
   \brief interrupt type

   Interrupts may be used to trigger task activation and continuation.
   The scheduled activation remains active after a trigger - the
   scheduled continuatin is removed automatically after triggering.

   In order to provide a list of registered tasks to a specific interrupt,
   the task control block is extended by 2 pointer. They are used for
   the 2 lists (continueTaskQueue and activateTaskQueue)

   The task objects have to provide methods to be called upon trigger the
   continuation (triggeredContinue()) and activation (triggeredActivate()).

   The sequence of triggering is in order of the list, which has a LIFO
   behavior. The execution according the tasks priority will be treated
   by the operating system. The complete trigger sequence is done while
   the tasks mutex is locked. Rescheduling may happen first after the
   completion of a trigger()-operation.

   Individual interrupt sources must be derived from Interrupt.
   Usually the ctor must register the object to the real interrupt
   source. The execution is usually triggered by a signal handler (UNIX)
   or a thread waiting for data (all systems) or interrupt service routine
   (microcontroller).
