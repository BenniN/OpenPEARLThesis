   class for mutual exclusion

   The runtime system needs atomic operations. They are guaranteed by
   usage of mutex variables. To enable plattform independent classes
   a generic mutex is necessary.
   This class defines the interface of the Mutex classes, which
   are plattform specific. Each plattform MUST realized such  a class
   Mutex, which fulfills this interface.
