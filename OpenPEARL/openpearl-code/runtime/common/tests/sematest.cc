\brief test program for simple semaphore operations

\page Testprograms

\section sematest
This module contains some tasks performing semaphore  operations

The solution looks in PEARL like:

\verbatim
DCL s1 SEMA PRESET(10);
DCL s2 SEMA PRESET(1);
DCL s3 SEMA PRESET(5);

DCL overflow SEMA PRESET (4294967294); ! 2^31-2 --> overflow after 2nd release
T1: TASK PRIO 10 MAIN;
   PUT 'T1 started' TO TERMINAL BY A,SKIP;
   REQUEST s1,s2;
   PUT 'T1' TO TERMINAL BY A,SKIP;
   REQUEST s1,s2;

  RELEASE overflow;
  ON SemaOverflow GOTO ok;
  RELEASE overflow;
  PUT 'signal raising failed' to TERMINAL BY A,SKIP;
  goto done;
ok:
  PUT 'got Signal Overflow Signal' to TERMINAL BY A,SKIP;
done:
   PUT 'T1 terminated' TO TERMINAL BY A,SKIP;
END;

T2: Task PRIO 2 MAIN;
   AFTER 5 SEC RESUME;
   PUT 'T2' TO TERMINAL BY A, SKIP;
   RELEASE s1;
   CONT T3 PRIO 5;    ! change prio of t3 -> is must run before T1
   AFTER 5 SEC RESUME;
   PUT 'T2' TO TERMINAL BY A, SKIP;
   RELEASE s2;
   AFTER 5 SEC RESUME;
   PUT 'T2' TO TERMINAL BY A, SKIP;
   RELEASE s2;
END;

T3: TASK PRIO 20 MAIN;
  AFTER 3 SEC RESUME;
  REQUEST s2;
  PUT 'T3' TO TERMINAL BY A,SKIP;
END;
\endverbatim


The output should look like:

\verbatim
Task T1 started
T1
t2
t2
t3
t2
T1
sequence: 1 1 3 2 2 3 2 1
 ok
\endverbatim
