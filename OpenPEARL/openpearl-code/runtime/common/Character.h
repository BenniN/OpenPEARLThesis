     \brief data type character

     implementation of data type character

   DIN66253-2 indicates in Tab 7.4 that the length of character strings
   is limited to 15 Bit.
   RTOS-UH indicates no limit

   DIN66253-2 indicates that characters use the ASCII character set.
   Control characters (TOFIXED() < 32) are quoted with '\';
   eg 'ABC\ 0d 0a \\ DE'
   would contain a string with ar CR and LF inside. The spaces between the hex
   encoded values are not precisely spezified. The encoding must be treated by
   the compiler.

   \note Proposal: The internal 8 bit characater set is used.
         Control characters are treated without any numerical
         restrictions.
         The length of character strings is limited to the range
         of FIXED(15) as written in the language reference.

   The 'LENGTH' operation, which defines the default length of strings,
   should be handled inside the compiler.
   This class implementation requires dedicated length information.

   The first valid index is '1' (according to the PEARL standard)


   The language reference indicates that assignment between character
   strings are only possible, if they have the same length.
   There is no explicit statement for this behavior.

   The slice operations are treated by the class CharSlice.

   A too long initializer or length value may lead the
   CharacterTooLong-signal.

   Indexed access to the elements may lead to CharterIndexOutOfRange-signal.

   \tparam length the length of the character string
