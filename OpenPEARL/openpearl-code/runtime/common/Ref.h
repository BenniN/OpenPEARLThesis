   Dereference of a REF variable

   The OpenPEARL system translates REF into native pointers, which are
   initialized with NULL. There is not explicit initialisation enforced
   by the language definition.
   Thus each access to the object via the  reference must check, if the
   pointer is valid. This test is done in this template method, which
   works for all kinds of references (except REF CHAR()) of the PEARL
   application.

   Usage in the C++ code (without explicit namespace):

   \code
   Fixed<15> x;
   Ref< Fixed<15> > y;
   ...
   Ref< Fixed<15> > y1(&x);  // auto initialization
   ...
   y = & x;           // assignment to the reference variable
   x = *y + x;   // usage in an expression
   *y = x;       // Usage in an assignment
   \endcode

   \tparam C the class of the referenced variable. This may be any
             kind of class.
