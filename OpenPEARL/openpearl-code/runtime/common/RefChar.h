   Type REF CHAR
   \brief REF CHAR Type for variable string length

   REF CHARs use a normal CHAR<x> variable as container for the
   stored characters. The RefChar provides additional information about
   current length and maximum length.

   It is easy to concatinate character variables and nice for flexible
   function calls.

   The functionality is located in template functions
   \see  storeRefChar

   <b>Sample PEARL code</b>
   <pre>
   DCL wrk CHARACTER(100);
   DCL result CHARACTER(50);
   DCL rc REF CHAR();
   rc := wrk;

   CONT rc := 'Hallo';
   CONT rc := CONT rc CAT ' Welt.';
   result := CONT rc;
   </pre>

   <b>possible compiler output</b>
   <pre>
   Character<100> wrk;
   Character<50> result;
   RefChar rc;

   rc.setRefChar(wrk);
   {
      Character<5> hello((char*)"Hallo");
      rc.add(hello);
   }
   {
      Character<6> welt((char*)" Welt.");
      rc.add(welt);
   }
   rc.store(result);
   </pre>
