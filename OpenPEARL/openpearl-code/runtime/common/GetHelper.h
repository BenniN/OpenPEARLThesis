\brief input formating  helper object

This class provides several helper routines for Get-processing.
The detection of field separators is realized. In case a field separator is
encountered within the field width, the field is terminated and the field
separator is discarded.

The EndOfLine is expected in UNIX style as simple newline character.
The I/O-processing must translate other behavior to this pattern.
