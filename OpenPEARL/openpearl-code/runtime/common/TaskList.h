      \brief Provide access to all defined tasks at run time

      This class prvides a list of all tasks in the system.

      To get ride of the "static initializer fiasco" this class
      is realized as Meyers singleton pattern. All static task object
      register at (static) instantiation at this object. The sequence
      of static initialisation with more than one compilation unit
      is not defined in C++ standard.

      Since PEARL has no dynamic creation of tasks there is no need to remove
      tasks from the list.
      The list is used in the comand line tool and by the automatic shutdown
      feature.

      Since PEARL provides only static tasks - there may not be a change
      in the tasklist during run time.
      There is not need for mutual exclusion protection.
