   \brief supply linked lists for task scheduling on interrupts

   PEARL allows several tasking methods to be scheduled on one
   interrupt. When the interrupt occurs, all scheduled tasking
   operation must be executed.
   To realize this behavior, a linked list of tasks is established.
   The links are strore in the task control block, which is derived
   from this class.

   This class provides attributes and methods to create two linked
   lists for tasks being scheduled with WHEN for activation and
   continuation.
