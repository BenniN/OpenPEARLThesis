\subsection{Linux specific}
The behavior of a PEARL interrupt is similar to a Unix signal,
or an error condition on an external device.

The class UnixSignal may serve as a reference how to create such a
system element.
If the PEARL interrupt should be trigegred by other  external events like
the break condition on the serial line, the corresponding device driver is
free to define an additional interrupt, which must be derived from the
interrupt base class (Interrupt)  and invoke the trigger-method on this 
object.
