   \brief generic non-basic systemdation class

   With this class it is possible to generate named pipe
   system devices. They are useful for testing the dation behavior
   and for data exchange with other applications.

   The implementation uses the class Pipe as container for PipeFile
   objects, which perform the i/o-operations.

   One parameter of the Ctor defines the number of open dations
   on one Pipe-object. The PipeFile objects are allocated in a pool,
   which is created at instantiation of the Pipe-object.
   At this point of execution the 'new' operation is allowed.
