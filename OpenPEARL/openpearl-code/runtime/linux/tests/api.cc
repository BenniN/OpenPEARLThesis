\brief API demo program

\page Testprograms

\section api tests/api.cc

This program demonstrates how the PEARL run time system may be used.
It activates two tasks.

The PEARL code for this program would be:
\verbatim
MODULE(api);
PROBLEM;
SPC console DATION ALPHIC OUT;

t1: TASK PRIO 1 MAIN;
   DCL d DURATION INIT(5 SEC);
   DCL dur DURATION;
   dur := d * 10.0;
   PUT '5 sec delay' TO console BY A,SKIP;
   AFTER d RESUME;
   PUT 'after 5 sec all 2 sec during 30 sec activate t2' TO console BY A,SKIP;
   AFTER 5 SEC ALL 2 SEC DURING 30 SEC ACTIVATE t2;
END;

DCL t2counter FIXED INIT(0);

t2: TASK PRIO 20;
   Duration d INIT(10 SEC);
   PUT 't2 started ',F(3) TO console BY A, SKIP;
   d := d / (t2counter-2);   // cause divide by zero signal
END;

MODEND.
\endverbatim

\cond TREAT_EXAMPLES
