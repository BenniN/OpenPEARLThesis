\brief task load test program

\page Testprograms

\section lot_of_tasks tests/lot_of_tasks.cc

This program tests the behavior of the system when a lot of tasks
is started. This is done using the API directly, since PEARL does not
support dynamic tasks.

The parameter N is set by a C-define.
N tasks are created in a loop. All task work on the same code, which
just incremsts a static viarable. i
All tasks are scheduled to start at the same time, 
which is the current time + 2 sec.
At the end of all tasks, this 
variable should contain the value N.

The main task prints all 1 second the number of
finished tasks until ether 8 seconds have passed, or all 
N workers have finished.
AT the end diagnostic message (ok/fail) is printed.
In case of fail, the exit code is 1 instead of 0.

\todo Due to an error in the pthread-library the program dies 
occationally with a segmentation fault.
see:  http://zhenprogramming.wordpress.com/2009/08/27/max-number-of-threads/
<br>This was seen with g++ 4.3.1 20080507
<br>In https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2862 there is
a note that this bug is fixed; lets wait for flow back to the pthread lib

Sample output at N=500:
\verbatim
wait max 8 sec for completion
1 sec: 28 (of 500) tasks finished
2 sec: 123 (of 500) tasks finished
3 sec: 209 (of 500) tasks finished
4 sec: 304 (of 500) tasks finished
5 sec: 399 (of 500) tasks finished
6 sec: 485 (of 500) tasks finished
7 sec: 500 (of 500) tasks finished
     seems to be ok
*** no more tasks active or scheduled --> stop
\endverbatim


The  log file contains detailed information about the run.
