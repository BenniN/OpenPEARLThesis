   \brief priority mapper

   Mapper object to map PEARL task priorities on the linux priority scheduling
   priorities.
   The range of PEARL priorities is from 1 to 255, where 1 is best and
   255 is lowest priority.
   The priority range in Linux is from 1 to 99 using the SCHED_RR scheduler.
   The best Linux priority is reserved for the operating system
   wrapper (os.cc).

   The priorities are mapped linear from PEARL(=1,2,3,...,255)  to
   SCHED_RR (=98,97,96,..,1.

   The PEARL priorities which are not mappable (97..254) produce a PEARL
   signal.

   PEARL Priority 255  is mapped to SCHED_RR priority = 1.

   The mechanism is realized as a singleton.
