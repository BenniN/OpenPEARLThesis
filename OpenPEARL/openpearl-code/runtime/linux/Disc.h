   /**
   \brief generic non-basic systemdation class

   With this class it is possible to generate most of linux
   system devices with behave like filesystems.
   PEARL requires that files are created upon a system dation.
   Historically, files were created on a disc. Windows does this still
   with e.g. C:

   UNIX has the philosophy that everything is a file.
   Therefore a folder represents something where files may become created.

   The implementation uses the class Disc as container for DiscFile
   objects, which perform the i/o-operations.

   One parameter of the Ctor defines the number of open files
   on one Disc-objects. The DiscFile objects are allocated in a pool,
   which is created at instantiation of the Disc-object.
   At this point of execution the 'new' operation is allowed.
