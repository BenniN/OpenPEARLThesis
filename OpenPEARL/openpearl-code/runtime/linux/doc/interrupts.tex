\section{Linux specific Interrupt Sources}

\subsection{UnixSignal}
Some UNIX signals may be used to trigger the PEARL application from outside.

Synopis: \verb|UnixSignal(nbr)|

The parameter \verb|nbr| denotes the linux signal number.
The following signals are supported:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Signal & Number \\
\hline
SIGHUP & 1 \\
SIGINT & 2 \\
SIGQUIT & 3 \\
SIGTERM & 15 \\
SIGUSR1 & 16 \\
SIGUSR2 & 17 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Note that there may be only one user defined name for each UNIX signal.
In case of attempting more than one user defined interrupt for 
a UNIX signal the InternalDatatypeSignal is induced 
during system initializing phase.
