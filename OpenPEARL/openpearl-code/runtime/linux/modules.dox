/**
\defgroup datatypes PEARL Data Types

\brief the PEARL simple data types.

The simple data types of PEARL are implemented in individual classes.
The types with individual length are implemented with templated classes.

These classes provide support for the PEARL data types

- Fixed  provides the type FIXED(0..63)
- Float
- Character
- RefCharacter implements REF CHAR
- Duration
- Clock
- BitString provides the type BIT(1..64)

/**
\defgroup io_common Classes for the Input and Output Operations

\brief These classes provide a common behavior of the input and
output statements for all platforms.

This is the API for the I/O operations to be used by the compiler.

- DationPG provides the API for PUT and GET
- DationRW provides the API for READ and WRITE
- DationTS provides the API for TAKE and SEND
- StringDationConvert provides the API for CONVERT
- DationDim1, DationDim2 and DationDim3 provides the DIM(), DIM(,) and DIM(,,)
  APIs

The other classes provide methods which are needed in multiple APIs like toX()

/**
\defgroup io_common_drivers Plattform Independend Drivers
\brief  Platform Independend Drivers
\ingroup io_common


These drivers are common to all supported target platforms. 
The following I2C-bus components are supported:

- ADS1115 as single ended ADC
- PCF8574 and PCF8574A port expanders
- LM75 temperature sensor

The interface to the platform dependent I2C bus providers is defined in 
I2CProvider.
