\section{System Overview}
FreeRTOS is used as scheduler. This system was selected, because
\begin{itemize}
\item it provides preemptive priority scheduling
\item it is avaliable on nearly every micro controller system
\item it is available in source code
\item it is distributed with a free licence type
\end{itemize}

PEARL tasks are mapped on FreeRTOS tasks. The required macros
are provided by \texttt{GenericTask.h}.

The FreeRTOS system has the following disadvantages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item task control blocks and task stack are allocated on the system
   heap on task creation. This may lead to memory fragmentation
\item FreeRTOS needs another task to clean memory allocation of a task if 
   the task deletes itself. Normally the idle task does this cleanup.
   In OpenPEARL is is possible, that no the cpu does not go idle 
   between a self termination of a task and it new activation. This 
   will lead into a hard system crash.
\end{enumerate}

Item 1 is obsolete with FreeRTOS version 10.
Since version 10, FreeRTOS support static TCB and stacks.

Item2 is solved by adding a new task parallel  to the idle task 
  in the freertos implementation (file tasks.c) with
  priority=\texttt{configPRIORITY\_MAX} and stack=\texttt{configSTACK\_MINIMAL}.
  This task wait for a notification. The notification is set, when 
  a task deletes itself by \texttt{vTaskDelete()}.


\section{System Architecture}
There are some problems with the linker and \texttt{weak} symbols.
The effect is that \texttt{weak} symbols are not overwritten, if
a corresponding strong symbol resides in a library.
\texttt{weak} symbols are usually used in the interrupt vector table.
This leads to
\begin{enumerate}
\item an object file which contains the interrupt service handlers like
   reset-handler, timer and other device service routines
\item a runtime library with the remaining object files
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{System Initialization}
The system initialization is described in the target specific part.

\subsection{Linkage}
The gcc linker option LTO is used to remove unused functions and data. 
The individual test and application programs are linked together with 
the static library.

\section{Unit Tests}
The linux trunk of the project, which is the main trunk, uses the
goole test framework to run unit tests on nearly all internal classes.
The complete gtest framework is too large to be run on the microcontroller.

A simple test framework, which supports the same syntax as gtest is provided
to run the unit tests on the target system.
The implementation resides in the files\footnote{ugtest stands for $\mu$gtest}

 \verb|ugtests/simpleTests.h| and 
 \verb|ugtests/simpleTests.cc| 

The following elements of gtest are provided:
\begin{description}
\item[TEST] defines a unit test
\item[EXPECT\_EQ] tests, whether the two given parameters are equal, 
   assuming an operator== exists.
\item[EXPECT\_STREQ] tests, whether the two given parameters are equal c string 
\item[EXPECT\_TRUE] tests, whether the  given parameter is non zero. 
\item[EXPECT\_FALSE] tests, whether the  given parameter is zero. 
\item[EXPECT\_THROW] tests, whether the first given expression throws
   an exception of the type as given as  second parameter.
\item[ASSERT\_...] is defined for all listed EXPECT-versions. 
\end{description}

\section{Service Task}
There is a high priority task, which perform service jobs from 
other tasks.
The priority of the service task is above all PEARL application
tasks.
This is similar to jobs in an conventionel operating
system. 

The service task receives the jobs via a FreeRTOS message queue. 
The queue entries consist of a struct like:
\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct { 
  void (*job)(void*param);
  void * param;
} ServiceJob;
\end{verbatim}
The first entry is a pointer to a function, which receives the second entry
as parameter.

This service task is used by the
\begin{description}
\item[timer facility], when a time period has expired
\item[OpenPEARL tasks], if they need a direct restart at their
     termination in cases of interrupt overrun.
\item[interrupt devices] to trigger the internal treatment
\end{description}

\section{System Console}
Each plattform needs a system console for emergency error logging.
The retarget mechanismn of the glibc needs access to stdin and stdout
to realize printf and scanf. These functions are nice to use during 
system debugging.
An uart is the first choice for this purpose. It is desired to multiplex
the system console with a normal dation. The input sources are:
\begin{itemize}
\item printf statements
\item Log-messages from the Log class
\item local echo characters from a user dation on the uart port
\end{itemize}

The  architecture consists a GenericUart class, which defines the low 
level interface 
of a concrete uart (e.q. Lpc17xxUartInternal). This class is
realized as singleton to make shure that only 1 instance for a 
concrete uart port is instantiated.
The GenericUart class performs the multiplexing of printf data,
user dation and actions for the xon/xoff-protocol.

The GenericUartDation class defines the additional interface of a
SystemDationNB call, which realizes a serial system dation. 

The launchpad toolchain required the implementation of several
low level glibc-function like  \verb|_read| and \verb|_write|.
The interface for the retarget job is realized in the platform
 specific Retarget object.
The interface may delegate the action  to a plattform specific class SystemConsole, which
is a singleton. 
E.g. in the Lpc1768 platform, the implementation of \verb|_read| and 
\verb|_write| starts in polling mode
and is switch over to interrupt mode, when FreeRTOS is started.

The class SystemConsole contains just the singleton and instantiates 
the system consol uart with plattform specific parameters.

The concrete SystemDationNB class for the uart with a system console
must use the low level implementation  of the uart. It must implement
the interfaces from SystemDationNB and GenericUartDation. 

\paragraph{Summary:}\ \\
GenericUart and GenericUartDation  are common to all micro
 controllers.

The plattform specific classes are very small:

\begin{itemize}
\item SystemDation
\item the low level uart interface
\item the complete uart interface
\item the  required functions of the the retargetr machanism
\end{itemize}

By this architecture the port to other controllers should be very simple.

\subsection{Sample Interactions for dationRead}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{XxxUart::dationRead()} stores the readcommand in \texttt{recvCommand} struct and 
     blocks itself on the \texttt{recvCommand.blockSema}
\item inside the receive interrupt, the \texttt{GenericUart::doReceiveChar()} method
    desides what to do
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item treat XON/XOF
    \item treat new line translation
    \item on the console interface the \texttt{Retarget::addNextStdInChar()}, if there is a scanf
        like function active and the newline translation is done\newline
    \item if none of the actions above were required the character is passed 
         \texttt{XxxUart::addReceivedChar()}, which will complete after some cycles the \texttt{recvCommand},
        which unblocks the \texttt{dationRead()} method
    \item if no comsumer of input characters is active and xon/xoff is selected, then XOFF will become
        sent at the next chance.
        \textbf{This is the action in this case study!}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sample Interactions for dationWrite}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{XxxUart::dationWrite()} stores the transmit command in \texttt{sendCommand} struct and 
     blocks itself on the \texttt{sendCommand.blockSema}
\item inside the transmit interrupt, the \texttt{GenericUart::sendNextChar()} method
    desides what to do 
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item treat XON/XOF
    \item treat new line translation
    \item on the console interface the \texttt{Retarget::getNextStdOutChar()} 
        will be treated with newline translation\newline
    \item if none of the actions above were required the \texttt{XxxUart::getNextTransmitChar()}
        is checked. If no more transmit characters are available, the \texttt{XxxxUart::sendCommand.blockSema}
        becomes released.
        \textbf{This is the action in this case study!}
    \end{enumerate}
\item the next transmit character is sent via \texttt{XxxUartInternal::sendChar()} to the 
    uart transmitter and we wait for the next transmit interrupt
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sample Interactions for printf}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{Retarget::\_write()} checks if interrupts are possible
  \begin{itemize}
    \item if no interrupts are possible, the text is sent in polling mode
    \item if interrupts are possible, the \texttt{StdOutJob} struct is set up \newline
          and the calling thread waits active until the output is completed
  \end{itemize}
\item inside the transmit interrupt, the \texttt{GenericUart::sendNextChar()} method
    desides what to do 
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item treat XON/XOF
    \item treat new line translation
    \item on the console interface the \texttt{Retarget::getNextStdOutChar()} 
        will be treated with newline translation\newline
        \textbf{This is the action in this case study!}
    \item if none of the actions above were required the \texttt{SystemDation::getNextTransmitChar()}
        is checked
    \end{enumerate}
\item the next transmit character is sent via \texttt{XxxUartInternal::sendChar()} to the 
    uart transmitter and we wait for the next transmit interrupt
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sample Interactions for scanf}
This part is not relevant and not tested. Local echo will be only available 
at system start. After the start of FreeRTOS no local echo will be available.
During the excution of the OpenPEARL application only printf-like functions
are used for debugging.


\section{Time Base}

The presence of a real time clock (RTC) is not guaranteed on a
microprocessor system.
This is no big problem for most PEARL applications, since they works 
in many cases with relative times.

FreeRTOS provides a tick based system time. The resolution is specified
in the file \texttt{FreeRTOSConfig.h} --- 
set in OpenPEARL to $1 ms$.

Some applications many require absolute times and more precise timing.
That's the reason why the FreeRTOS provided timers are not used. 
There is an implemtation of the \texttt{itimer} system. This 
implementation allows the specification of a time source.
This system was introduced  by Jonas Meyer in his thesis.

\subsection{Timer-Treatment}
The principle of operation of the implementation of the timer facility is
that there are two lists of timer entries. A timer entry contains 
the information about an initial delay and a repetition rate of the timer.
This is similar to the itimer of POSIX.
The operation is cyclic:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the definition of a new timer inserts the correspondig timer entry
   in the sorted list of active timers
\item The timer entry which elapses first defines the setup of a hardware timer.
\item As soon as the hardware timer elapses, the interrupt service  routine
triggers the timer task to continue.
\item The timer task checks which timers have elapsed and performs the 
callback of the defined timer. This callback is implemented in the
class TaskTimerCommon.
\item if an elapsed timer should operate repetitive, the timer is rescheduled
   at the time $currentSchedule + period$. \
	If the elapsed timer is a oneshot timer, it is added in the free-list.
\item the next timer entry in the active list defines the new delay for the
  next hardware timer delay. This delay is limited to one second. If the 
  desired period is longer than one second, several iterations are required.
\end{enumerate}

The implementation of the hardware specific part
(e.g. interrupt service routine) must be implemented in the concrete
timer facilities. The FreeRTOSClock provides this bevavior on base
of the 1ms system tick.

Each timer informs the service task about time exprirations and 
sends its own callback function pointer for further treatment.

\subsection{class FreeRTOSClock}
The class TaskTimer provides the FreeRTOS tick as
base for itimers.
The absolute time is set to 1.1.2016 0:0:0 at system startup.

Other time sources are plattform specific and described there.

\section{Modification in FreeRTOS}
FreeRTOS was modified in the following points:
\begin{description}
\item[getTaskCurrentFreeStack] is a new function, which returns the number
   of free stack element (of size 32 bit) on the current active tasks stack.
   This feature is enabled by the option
    \texttt{INCLUDE\_xTaskGetCurrentFreeStack}
\end{description}

\section{Stack Checking}
The gcc tool chain provides the possibility of code instrumentation
for tracing. The option \texttt{-finstrument-functions} additional
function call at each function entry and exit of the compilation unit.
The corresponding functions must be supplied by the application program.

The signature of the functions is:
\begin{verbatim}
extern "C" {
void __cyg_profile_func_enter(void*this_fn, void* call_site)
     __attribute__((no_instrument_function));

void __cyg_profile_func_exit(void*this_fn, void* call_site)
     __attribute__((no_instrument_function));
};
\end{verbatim}

The configuration option \texttt{CONFIG\_LPC1768\_CHECK\_STACK\_OVERFLOW}
controls the usage of the compiler option and inclusion of the
module \texttt{FreeRTOS/addOns/checkStackOverflow.cc}.


In case of the remaining stack of less than 250 elements (1000 bytes), or a
remaining unused size of less than 250 elements will cause the raising
of the signal StackOverflowSignal. This signal is intended to be non catchable
by the application program. 
The compiler arm-non-eabi-g++ v4.9.3 proved to need approximatelly 190 stack elements to perform the stack unrolling, the limit should not be set with caution.

The monitoring of functions of the template classes for Fixed and Bit 
is switched off for runtime efficiency.

\section{Heap usage}
FreeRTOS uses for several resources like tcp, stacks, queues, semaphores 
on the heap.
For OpenPEARL, the heap is configured as static data array of a fixed size.
A new heap allocator (heap\_1\_2.c) provides a {\em pool allocation pattern}
for heap elements to avoid memory fragmentation, if any heap element
of freed and allocated cyclic.

Usually FreeRTOS tasks locate stack and tcb on the heap. 
These elements are allocates and released at task start and termination.
This would produce heap fragmentation, when task stacks have different lengths.
To avoid the fragmentation, stacks and tcbs are allocated static in the
application code.

A OpenPEARL task needs aside from the applications data:

\begin{tabular}{lcc}
    & .bss & FreeRTOS Heap \\
tcb & 300 byte & 88 byte \\
stack & 30 - 2400 byte & - \\
\end{tabular} 

Note: Stack checking requires a unused buffer of 800 bytes!

Semphores and queues are not deleted during the lifetime of an 
OpenPEARL-application. They are still allocted on the heap of the application.
Note: All OpenPEARL semaphores uses one (1!) FreeRTOS semaphore together.

The heap of the c-library is made available by the linker script. 
Maybe some C++-objects are allocated in this heap.
This should only be used, if these objects are never deleted.


\section{Stack Size and Allocation Control}
{\em missing part; 
proposal: pseudo devices allow the specification of stack size.

this will be solved together with the cross module linker
}

\section{Added Features to FreeRTOS and glib-c}
There are some additional functions in \texttt{FreeRTOS/addOns},
 which supply the toolchain
with UNIX-like time functions like gettimeofday.
\begin{description}
\item[clock.c]provides gettimeofday and some more
\item[timer.c] provides the itimers
\item[testStackOverflow.cc] provides the implementation of the 
  stack checking profiling function
\item[service.c] provides the service task
\end{description}

Implementation of FreeRTOS Hooks:
\begin{description}
\item[assert.c] provides the implementation of the function
  \texttt{assert()}, which is used in FreeRTOS to verify
  proper operation
\item[FreeRTOSHooks.c] provides some error hooks for stack and heap overflow.
\end{description}

\section{Tasks}
\label{freertos_tasking}

The task mapping is described in the thesis of
 Florian Mahlecke in detail.

In short:
\begin{itemize}
\item GenericTask.h defines C-macros for task declararion and specification
\item Each PEARL task is derived from the class {\em Task} (\verb|Task.cc|).
      The tasking methods are implemented in \verb|Task.cc|.
\item Each PEARL task implements the method \verb|task(TaskCommon*me)| 
    with the C++ code generated by the compiler.
\item {
  \begin{description}
  \item[class Task] provides the required plattform specific implementation
     of the tasking methods. The automatic restart of a task in case of
     \verb|WHEN ... ACTIVATE| overruns is treated by the service task.
  \item[class TaskTimer] provides the time related stuff for the tasking
     methods. This class is working on base of the itimer extension 
     in \texttt{FreeRTOS/addOns}
  \item[class PrioMapper] provides a 1:1 mapping of PEARL to FreeRTOS
      priorities. Furthermore is provides the list of other used
      priorities in the system for background threads like the timer task.
      For details about the list of background task, please 
      check the doxgen documenation of the class PrioMapper.
  \end{description}
}
\item TerminateSuspended, TerminateIo must be described!!
\end{itemize}


\section{Logging}
The logging is done slightly different to the linux version.
In order to safe stack in the application tasks, the formatting is passed
to a special log-task which runs with high priority.
The logging class checks for each logging request if the FreeRTOS scheduler
is running. If the scheduler is not running - the formatting is done in the 
context of the calling thread. If the scheduler is running, the parameters
are passed to the log-task.
This mechanism reduces the stack usage of the logging down to 17 words. This
is important for the case of logging the stack overflow situation.


\section{Device Driver}
\label{sec_microcontroller_devicedriver}

The device drivers should be implemented with zero-copy principle.
If a background task is suitable for the device operation, the 
tasks priority must be registered in the class PrioMapper. The usage
of the the same priority for several devices is ok.

Usually, the device driver is called in the context of the calling thread.
The operation of the driver job is passed to an interrupt service routine and
the calling thread is blocked by a FreeRTOS mechanism e.q. binary semaphore.
At completion of the driver job in the isr the calling thread is continued.

The semaphore handle will be a attribute of the driver class.
\begin{verbatim}
SemaphoreHandle_t blockSema;
\end{verbatim}

 In the ctor,
the semaphore will be created with 
\begin{verbatim}
blockSema = xSemaphoreCreateBinary();
\end{verbatim}

The read/write operation triggers usually the interrupt mechanism and blocks
the calling thread like:
\begin{verbatim}
xSemaphoreTake(blockSema, portMAX_DELAY);
\end{verbatim}


When the interrupt service routine detects that the i/o-operation is completed
the semaphore becomes released:
\begin{verbatim}
xSemaphoreGiveFromISR(recvCommand.blockSema, NULL);
\end{verbatim}

A device driver is ether derived from \verb|SystemDationNB|,
 \verb|SystemdationB| or \verb|Interrupt|.
It must implement the virtual methods according their
expected behavior. For details please check the doxygen documentation
of these methods.

UserdationNB works internally only with the newline character to 
perform a skip. The translation into carriage return and linefeed must
be done in the driver if this is desired.

The usual device driver does not support reentrant operations from
different tasks. 
The mechanism of the \verb|UserDation| enshures that only one dation
operation is active at on time on the same userdation. In cases, where
a system device may be used in more than one userdation, a buffering
algorithmn must be implemented. 

The usual kind of operation is:
\begin{enumerate}
\item provide an interrupt service routine with a name fitting to the
   setting in \verb|startup_xxx.S|
\item If the controller supports interrupt prioritios,
choose an interrupt priority, which fits to the system design.
 The log-device should have better priority than all other
 system device to allow print-statements for debugging purpose.
\item check the device parameters in the ctor. The ctor is the last chance to
   allocate any memory on the FreeRTOS-heap.
\item provide the virtual methods from the base class. Mutual exclusion
   between the API methods and the interrupt service routine may
   be achived by disabling the corresponding interrupt in the NVIC.
\item create test applications for 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item google tests for e.g. tests in the ctor
  \item sample PEARL application, maybe  written in C++ to verify
        the device operation
  \end{enumerate}
\item add device description is the documentation, as
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item section in the plattform specific part
  \item as entry in the table of devices
  \end{enumerate}
\item supply the device description for the IMC as described in the IMC-documentation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Special Treatment for SUSPEND and TERMINATE during an I/O Operation}
As described in the platform independend part, the suspend or termination request
is delegated to the dations methods \texttt{suspend()} and \texttt{terminate()}.

The implementation of these functions depend on the communication mechanism 
between interrupt service routine and application thread. 
In case of a semaphore block/unblockFromIsr the methods may set flags for the desired
operations and unblock the semaphore. 
The unblocked device driver must check the flags and treat them. In case of suspend, 
it should suspend the calling thread.
In case of termination, it must terminate the i/o request with the interrupt service routine
and throw the \texttt{TerminateRequestSignal}  to free all above locking mechanisms.

If a queue is used a special value may be transmitted to the calling thread to trigger 
the necessary operations like in the block/unblock case.

\input{interrupt_priorities.tex}

\section{FAT File System}
In order to provide FAT file system facilities, the code from Chan
is used. 
The licence provides enough freedom to use the code.

The FatFs module is configurable to support different features. 
The selected features are:
\begin{itemize}
\item 2 volumes (0: for SD and 1: for USB-memory stick)
\item volume locking for concurrent usage
\item short file names,
      since Microsoft has a patent on the long file name feature
\item only one (1) partiion on the volume
\item codepage ???
\item .... ??
\end{itemize}

The structure is shown in fig \ref{fig_chanfs}.
\begin{figure}
\setlength{\unitlength}{1mm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture} [
    node distance=2.0cm,
    block/.style= {rectangle, draw=black,
                   thick,
                   text centered,
                   minimum width={width("Low Level Device Control")+2pt},
                   }]
    \node[block](lowLevDevContr)at (0,10)
            {\shortstack{Low Level Device Control\\
                         RTC, SD-Card, USB, ...}};
    \node[block, above=0.2cm of lowLevDevContr](fatfs) {FatFs Module};
    \node[block, above=0.2cm of fatfs](app) {Application};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{structure of Chan FatFs}
\label{fig_chanfs}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The date and time for the FAT system is derived from the system time
in the FatFs.cpp module.

For device locking, FreeRTOS semaphores are used by Elm Chan.

To select the device driver, the sample version of disk.io 
in the demonstration code  used a switch-statement.
This was modified. Now the volume specific
drivers register themself at diskio.c during their setup (ctor).
This safes memory footprint, since only the really used volumes reside in
the object file.
The specific device drivers are selected in the OpenPEARL system part.
.
The following volume names are reserved in OpenPEARL:
\begin{description}
\item[0:/] denotes the SD-card
\item[1:/] denotes the USB-memory stick
\end{description}

\subsection{Generic SD-Card via SPI Support}
\label{sec:SDCardSpi}
The operation of SD-cards is described in the "'SD Specifications -- 
Simplified Specification V6.0"' and in the online paper of
Elm Chan.

The operation need the wait for replies of the card. The duration
varies between some mircoseconds and some milliseconds. If the 
operation is not finished in some poll cycles, the calling thread 
is delayed for 2 ticks (2 ms) in order to safe cpu time for other threads.

The platform specific hardware support function for
\begin{itemize}
\item detect card \verb|spiIsCardInserted|
\item drive the CS line \verb|spiSelect|
\item set transmission speed \verb|spiHighSpeed|
\item single byte transfer \verb|spiRwByte|
\item send block \verb|spiSendBlock|
\item receive block \verb|spiReadBlock|
\end{itemize}
are defined as pure virtual. They must be supported by the platform specific 
sdcard driver.


\paragraph{Note:} There is no support for MMC crads, since UI found no card
to test. The code was tested with cards of 2GB and 8GB size.
If other cards are detected a warning will be issued.

\section{Fake Types of Packages}
In order to keep the API of OpenPEARL easy, it is desired not to include
package specific types from e.g. FreeRTOS or Chan's FatFS package 
in the global PearlIncludes.h header.

\subsection{Analysis}
The implementation modules need the concrete package headers.
The specification modules (header-files) need knownledge about 
specific types, in order to reserve memory or pointers. 
Maybe \verb|define| constants are required in a header file.

If an API relevant header file would include an internal package specific
header file, this package specific header file will be also part of 
the PearlIncludes. 

A detailed look on the problem shows, that the API header need 
information about the size and native type of the package specific types.

If we provide a {\em fake} implementaion using only standard types,
the OpenPEARL API header becomes free of the internal package types.

\subsection{Solution}
In FreeRTOS/addOns there are some utility-files, which generate the header file 
\verb|FakeTypes.h| for the needed internal types.

\begin{description}
\item[mkFakeTypes.c] defines data of the required types in different sections.
This file ist compiled by the target plattform C-compiler and inspected by
the {\em size} utility, which dumps the sizes of all sections in an object file.
\item[fakeTypes.c] is a C-program, which runs on the host system. It reads
the output of the {\em size} command and generates the file \verb|FakeTypes.h|.
\item[check\_FakeTypes.c] is a C-source file, which uses the FakeTypes.h and 
the original includes as well. It verifies that the original and
the faked types deliver the same sizes. In case of differences, there will be
some compilation errors. The program \verb|fakeTypes.c| must be adjusted
in this case.
\end{description}

The faked types are generated by the target {\em Makefile}.
An example may be found in the lpc1768-plattform part.

\section{To be done}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item provide device drivers for the standard devices (Ethernet)
  \item device wait queue for tasks in begin/end-sequence?
  \end{itemize}
