   /**
   \brief timer facility for task scheduling

   This class provides the timer functions required for task scheduling.

   A timer may be set using the PEARL scheduling parameters.
   A timer my be started. Using the start operation repeatedly will
   restart the timer if it is not expired, or will restart it.
   A timer may be cancelled to disable any further start unless
   it is set again.

   The linux itimer facility is used to realize the timers.
   These itimers are implemented in the FreeRTOS/addOns/timer.c.

   The FreeRTOS variant don't emit a signal, they invoke a callback
   function at the expiration of a timer.
   The timer thread delegates the treatment
   of the timer event of a callback function, which is specified in the
   create()-method
