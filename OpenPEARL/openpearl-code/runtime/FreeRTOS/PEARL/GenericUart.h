   \brief Generic uart  low level support with Xon/Xoff protocol support

   Base class for all uart devices. Each real uart is derived from this class.
   This class is implemented as singleton, since it is also responsible
   to supply the support for printf via the retarget-mechanisme of the
   glibc. During the initialization of retarget the UART0-interface is 
   setup with default values. 

   In the very beginning in startup, we need a plattform specific
   uart object for the 
   retarget stuff. This is handled by a plattform specific
   implementation of SystemConsole.
   The creation of the SystemConsole is needed before the call of main.
   So we implement an singleton for the system console, which will instantiate
   the internal uart object.
   If a system dation is created by the PEARL application upon
   the same uart interface, the system dation
   object attaches the internal uart object.
   All operations of the system dation
   object is passed to the internal uart object.

   The internal uart object must be aware, if there is a system dation
   object, which may want to receive input data. Thus a system dation 
   must register a callback method to pass the output data if no 
   stdout or xon/xoff stuff is required.
