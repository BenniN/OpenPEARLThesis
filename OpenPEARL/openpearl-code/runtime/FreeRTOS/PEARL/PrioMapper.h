    \brief priority mapper

    Mapper object to map PEARL task priorities on the FreeRTOS priority
    scheduling priorities.
    The range of PEARL priorities is from 1 to 255, where 1 is best and
    255 is lowest priority.
    The priority range in FreeRTOS is from 1 to configMAX_PRIORITIES - 1.
    The FreeRTOS timer task has best priority (configMAX_PRIORITIES-1).

    The priorities are mapped linear from PEARL(=1,2,3,...,255)  to
    FreeRTOS priorities  (=255,254,..,1).

    The mechanism is realized as a singleton.
