\chapter{Interrupt}
An interrupt is an asynchrous event from the outside world.
It is \textbf{NOT} the hardware interrupt of the processor.

\section{Specification and Declaration}
An interrupt is declared in the system part.

Example: Declare the identifier \verb|ctrlc| as the plattform specific
interrupt source \verb|^C|

\begin{verbatim}
ctrlc: UnixSignal(2);
\end{verbatim}

The specification takes place in the problem part:

\begin{verbatim}
SPC ctrlc INTERRUPT;
\end{verbatim}

A specific plattform may support several different interrupt sources.
All concrete interrupt sources must be derived from the parent class
\verb|pearlrt::Interrupt|.


\section{C++ Mapping between System and Problem Part}
The user defined identifier in the system part denotes a specifice interrupt
source. The identifier in the problem part denotes a generalized interrupt.
The compiler should generate a pointer to the generalized interrupt object like
shown in the example below:

\begin{PEARLCode}
SYSTEM;
  ctrlc: UnixSignal(2);
PROBLEM;
   SPC ctrlc INTERRUPT;
\end{PEARLCode}

The user supplied identifier (\verb|ctrlc|) is used as base of derived
identifiers.
\begin{description}
\item[sys\_] prefix denotes the real defined interrupt object 
\item[\_] prefix (as usual for all user supplied idetifiers) denotes the
    pointer to the generalized interrupt object.
\end{description}

\begin{CppCode}
// SYSTEM;
static pearlrt::UnixSignal sys_ctrlc(2);
       pearlrt::Interrupt * _ctrlc = (pearlrt::Interrupt*)&sys_ctrlc;
// PROBLEM;
extern pearlrt::Interrupt * _ctrlc;
\end{CppCode}

\section{Method Mapping}
The interrupt class provides methods for the PEARL language statements
working directly on interrupts.

The translation from PEARL to C++ is generic. 
The interrupt identifier is a pointer to the generalized interrupt object.

\begin{methodMapping}
\verb|ENABLE|  & \verb|enable()| & \\
\verb|DISABLE|  & \verb|disable()|&  \\
\verb|TRIGGER|  & \verb|trigger()| & \\
\end{methodMapping}

Example:

\begin{PEARLCode}
! ctrlc is specified as INTERRUPT;
...
ENABLE ctrlc;
DISABLE ctrlc;
TRIGGER ctrlc;
\end{PEARLCode}

Should translate into:
\begin{CppCode}
_ctrlc->enable();
_ctrlc->disable();
_ctrlc->trigger();
\end{CppCode}
