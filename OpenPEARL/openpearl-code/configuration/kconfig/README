This stuff was extracted from the linux kernel sources version 4.10.1

It seems that the GPL applies to this code.

The Makefile was modified for standalone operation under linux.
confdata.c was modified to suppress the split_config-output 
           include/ does not contain a config/-directory any longer
           and it produces a LaTeX fitting include
ztab.conf.c_shipped was modified to show "OpenPEARL System Configuration"
