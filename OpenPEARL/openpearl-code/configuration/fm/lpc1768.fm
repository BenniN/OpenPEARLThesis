config LPC1768_CHECK_STACK_OVERFLOW
	boolean "check stack overflow in application code"
	default y
	help
	This adds a function call in each funtion entry (and exit)
        in order to check the current value of the stack pointer.
	If the stack pointer is near to/or beyond of the stack limit
        a non catchable exception is raised and the task is terminated.
	
	This option relies on the -finstrument-functions option of 
	the g++ compiler.
