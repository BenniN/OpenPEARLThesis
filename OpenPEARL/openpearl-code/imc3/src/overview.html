<h1>Overview IMC V2

<h2>Principle of Operation</h2>
The IMC checks the compatibility of the module-module interface.
The specifications and declarations of global elements must fit together.
The declaration may occur in the PROBLEM-part as well as in the SYSTEM-part.
By default, all elements in the sytem part are global.

In order to complete the job, the IMC reads the module interace definition, which is created
by the compiler as a XML-file with the same name as the compiled module.
This XML-file contains information about
<ul>
<li>the system part with the definition of 
   <ul>
   <li>dations
   <li>signals
   <li>interrupts
   <li>configuration 
   </ul>
<li>the problem part with  lkklk
  <ol>
   <li>definition of global elements like
      <ul>
      <li>tasks
      <li>procedures
      <li>variables
      </ul>
   <li>specifications of system part definitions
   <li>specifications of global elements from other modules
       (system part elements and problem part elements) 
   </ol>
</ul>

The IMC creates dictionaries with the name and the location in the DOM-tree of
the elements. Some other attributes for simple access enrich the entries 
like line number of the enrty in the source file or usage flags to detect 
unused definitions.

Further details remain in the DOM-tree. 
They are accessed on demand while processing the modules.

<h2>Major build steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Read the input files and create the dictionaries. 
<li>run several checks about the correctness of invocation parameters,
    conflicts of usage of nonsharable ressources, ...
<li>if no error occurred, the represenation of the system parts of all modules
  is created
</ol> 
Details about the check definition are located in the LaTeX documentation
of the imc.


<h1>XML-File Structure</h1>
<h2>Platform Definition</h2>
The platform definition is decribed in the LaTeX documentation of the IMC.

<h2>Compiler Output per Module</h2>
The compiler creates for each source file an interface definition file 
in xml format.
The system part is represented in the tree &lt;system&gt; 
and the problem part in the tree $lt;problem&gt;.

<h3>System Part</h3>
The system part definition are ether &lt;username&gt; or &lt;configuration&gt;.
Both may have &lt;parameters&gt; and &lt;associations&gt;.
An association may also have pparameters.
An association may be a username or another association.
Associations are represented as subtree of the username or configuration tag.

<h3>Problem Part</h3>
The compiler creates &lt;spc> and &lt;dcl&gt; tags for specification
 and declaration 
of global symbols. These tags have the following attributes:
<dl>
<dt>name</dt><dd>the name of the symbol</dd>
<dt>line</dt><dd>the line number of the declaraction or specification</dd>
<dt>type</dt><dd>the type of the symbol. 
  <ul>
  <li>simple types, dations, signals, interrupts, tasks, semaphores and bolt
      elements  are given in their PEARL nottaion with precission or length</li>
  <li> arrays are denoted with prepended virtual dimnsion list (separated with space)</li>
  <li>structs are denoted with their C++ identifier</li>
  <li>REF is prepended literally with a space as separator</li>
</dd>
</dl>
The attribute 'global' is optional and default
 to the current module name.

Dations have additional elements for their attributes and data type
as described in  the platform definition.

Procedures have additional tags parameters and returns for the 
procedure parameters and the result type.
The parameters is a comma separated string of all parameters as
in a procedure secification. The return type ie encoded like the data
tag in dations.
